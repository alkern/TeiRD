          <div3 n="1" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made . And he said unto the woman , Yea , hath God said , Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden ?</div3>
          <div3 n="2" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">And the woman said unto the serpent , We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden :</div3>
          <div3 n="3" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden , God hath said , Ye shall not eat of it , neither shall ye touch it , lest ye die .</div3>
          <div3 n="4" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">And the serpent said unto the woman , Ye shall not surely die :</div3>
          <div3 n="5" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof , then your eyes shall be opened , and ye shall be as gods , knowing good and evil .</div3>
          <div3 n="6" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food , and that it was pleasant to the eyes , and a tree to be desired to make one wise , she took of the fruit thereof , and did eat , and gave also unto her husband with her ; and he did eat .</div3>
          <div3 n="7" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">And the eyes of them both were opened , and they knew that they were naked ; and they sewed fig leaves together , and made themselves aprons .</div3>
          <div3 n="8" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day : and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden .</div3>
          <div3 n="9" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">And the LORD God called unto Adam , and said unto him , Where art thou ?</div3>
          <div3 n="10" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">And he said , I heard thy voice in the garden , and I was afraid , because I was naked ; and I hid myself .</div3>
          <div3 n="11" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">And he said , Who told thee that thou wast naked ? Hast thou eaten of the tree , whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat ?</div3>
          <div3 n="12" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">And the man said , The woman whom thou gavest to be with me , she gave me of the tree , and I did eat .</div3>
          <div3 n="13" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">And the LORD God said unto the woman , What is this that thou hast done ? And the woman said , The serpent beguiled me , and I did eat .</div3>
          <div3 n="14" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">And the LORD God said unto the serpent , Because thou hast done this , thou art cursed above all cattle , and above every beast of the field ; upon thy belly shalt thou go , and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life :</div3>
          <div3 n="15" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">And I will put enmity between thee and the woman , and between thy seed and her seed ; it shall bruise thy head , and thou shalt bruise his heel .</div3>
          <div3 n="16" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">Unto the woman he said , I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception ; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children ; and thy desire shall be to thy husband , and he shall rule over thee .</div3>
          <div3 n="17" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">And unto Adam he said , Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife , and hast eaten of the tree , of which I commanded thee , saying , Thou shalt not eat of it : cursed is the ground for thy sake ; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life ;</div3>
          <div3 n="18" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee ; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field ;</div3>
          <div3 n="19" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread , till thou return unto the ground ; for out of it wast thou taken : for dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return .</div3>
          <div3 n="20" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">And Adam called his wife's name Eve ; because she was the mother of all living .</div3>
          <div3 n="21" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins , and clothed them .</div3>
          <div3 n="22" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">And the LORD God said , Behold , the man is become as one of us , to know good and evil : and now , lest he put forth his hand , and take also of the tree of life , and eat , and live for ever :</div3>
          <div3 n="23" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden , to till the ground from whence he was taken .</div3>
          <div3 n="24" type="sentence" xml:lang="eng">So he drove out the man ; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims , and a flaming sword which turned every way , to keep the way of the tree of life .</div3>
